          <p>GAIN, the Alliance of Bioversity and CIAT, and EAT joined forces to conduct a three-stage Delphi study, Project Disrupt: Healthy Diets on a Healthy Planet  (March - June of 2020). The goal was to identify and investigate game-changing innovations that will help to enable resilient, affordable, safe, and nutritious diets for the current and growing global population while restoring and safeguarding our environment by 2030.</p>

          <p>An adapted Delphi methodology was used and 52 expert panellists - representing 3 real-world settings in Ethiopia, Mozambique and Bangladesh - engaged in 3 rounds of virtual discussion sessions, each followed by an online anonymized survey to capture input and insights. In round one 85 unique innovations surfaced with the potential to reduce both malnutrition and environmental degradation. These represent a combination of complementary types of technological and nature-based solutions as well as policy/social approaches. A broad range of targets are covered, involving various stakeholders and benefitting a diverse range of users. The innovations span the entire supply chain and range in maturity from the conceptual/design phase through those moving to scale (but not necessarily in one of these 3 settings). In round two the panellists ranked these 85 innovations - clustered into 6 categories - according to their potential for impact for positive change in each setting and scored against 4 types of criteria for dietary health, planet health, equity, and leapfrogging potential.</p>
           
          <p>In this database we invite you to explore the innovation scores from the second round of the Delphi study for Project Disrupt. Use the menu links above to see the innovations ranked relative to their overall score or for each specific setting. As this project aimed at identifying “win-win” innovations, the last menu link - <a href="planetdiet.html">Enhancing diets and planet scores</a> - how the innovations mapped according to their potential to enhance both dietary and planet health.</p>
